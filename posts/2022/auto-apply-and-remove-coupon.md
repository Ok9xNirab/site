It's very good idea to give your customer some discounts. You can increase your sells to give some discounts based on certain conditions.

These **certain conditions** can be something like :

- If anyone has equal OR greater than **X amount of items** in carts Then give **Y amount discount** in checkout as coupons.
- If anyone put **X quentity of items** in carts Then give **Y quentity discount** in checkout as coupons.
- Apply automatic coupon when anyone get into site via **specific custom url**.
- If **Subtotal** is greater than X then give Y discount.

and many more ...

You can do this in two ways.

1. Using third-party plugins
   > Checkout [Advance Coupons for Woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advance-coupons-for-woocommerce/) plugin which can extends default WooCommerce coupon features.
2. Write own solution Programmatically
